It involves building a model on Keras.
The process involves Loading and Cleaning the Dataset, checking how many data points we have.
Check the dataset for any missing values, Splitting data into predictors and target
Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets respectively, which are mutually exclusive. After which, we train with the training set and test with the testing set.
Building a baseline model which involves building a Neural Network, fitting the model in training data and evaluated it using test data.
Normalizing the data, Increasing the number of epochs, Increasing the number of hidden layers.
