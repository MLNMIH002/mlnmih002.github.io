Crack detection has vital importance for structural health monitoring and inspection.
In this project, a classifier using a pre-trained model that would detect cracks in images of concrete is built.
For problem formulation, images of cracked concrete are denoted as the positive class and images of concrete with no cracks as the negative class.
